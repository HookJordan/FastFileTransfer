# FFT- FastFileTransfer ![Build App](https://github.com/HookJordan/FastFileTransfer/workflows/Build%20App/badge.svg)
FFT or FastFileTransfer is a Windows Form Application that provides the user with an alternative remote file transfer system. Various customizations have been included in the application to the allow the user to tweak to their needs with regards to needs with speed and security in mind. There are currently 4 option encryption algorithms available including: 
- Simple XOR cipher
- RC4 Encryption (Default)
- Blowfish (ECB Mode)
- AES (CBC Mode)

The encryption algorithm is applied to all network communication throughout the application to help ensure your network traffic is secured and protected from data sniffers. In addition to the encryption options, various compression algorithms are also available such as: 
- GZIP 
- LZO (http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/)
- LZMA (https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html)

Please note the compression algorithms are only applied to file transfer related network traffic.
